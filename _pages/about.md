I am a Ph.D. student in School of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, advised by Prof. Tian and Prof. Jin. My research interests include Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Haptic or Tactile Feedbacks, and I also work on Embodied AI with my partner [Ang He](https://heang2.github.io/heang.github.io/), in Institute of Trustworthy Embodied AI, Fudan University.

I also build a data-driven personal website to share my research results and projects. You can visit it at [cloudiers.github.io](https://cloudiers.github.io/).
